# C++ Client-Server communication with sockets and multithreading (Windows APIs)


This project implements client-server communication system in C++ for Windows, utilizing APIs-sockets-multithreading.
Both the client and server components uses two threads that synchronize to handle message sending/receiving. 
The project demonstrates the use of multithreading for concurrent operations.

In the code change the DEFAULT_IP for a remote connection, I've tested it in local.
